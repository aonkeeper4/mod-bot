# mod-bot
an all-in-one discord bot made by a bored cs student

current features:
- suggestions (fancy reactions ui) (actionbar coming soon)
- polls (wip) (python threading is confusing)

planned features:
- moderation / automoderation
- reaction roles / autoroles
- music (youtube pls no cease and desist)
- games - tetris, snake, pong, 2048
- react-based web interface (an excuse for me to learn react)
- configurability
- being better than robotop by gdcolon
